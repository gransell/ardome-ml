        /// A class that encapsulates the abstract notion of a job
        /** Jobs are carried out by worker objects. You create a job_base (must
            be a derived class since do_work is abstract) and assigns it to a 
            shared_ptr<job_base> which you add to a worker or a CThread_pool.
            If you keep the reference of the job you can wait for it to 
            complete via wait_for_job_done.

            Another way to wait for completion is to register a callback
            that will be notified when the job is done.

            Each job has a priority that will place it before lower prioritized
            jobs in a job queue. The priority is set in the constructor of the 
            job.
